Description: The luxury business is a $1.5 trillion dollar industry, and we’re revolutionizing it one consignment at a time. Let us explain. We started small. Working at her kitchen table and visiting consignor homes with a U-Haul, our fearless leader CEO Julie Wainwright built The RealReal out of her own home. Today, it’s the premier site for online luxury consignment with multiple locations across the United States that accept and ship product worldwide.
